    "## What is it?\n",
    "With `trl` you can train transformer language models with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The library is built with the `transformer` library by  ðŸ¤— Hugging Face ([link](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)). Therefore, pre-trained language models can be directly loaded via the transformer interface. At this point only GTP2 is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Highlights:**\n",
    "- GPT2 model with a value head: A transformer model with an additional scalar output for each token which can be used as a value function in reinforcement learning.\n",
    "- PPOTrainer: A PPO trainer for language models that just needs (query, response, reward) triplets to optimise the language model.\n",
    "- Example: Train GPT2 to generate positive movie reviews with a BERT sentiment classifier."

    "## How it works\n",
    "Fine-tuning a language model via PPO consists of roughly three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rollout**: The language model generates a response or continuation based on query which could be the start of a sentence.\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: The query and response are evaluated with a function, model, human feedback or some combination of them. The important thing is that this process should yield a scalar value for each query/response pair.\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: This is the most complex part. In the optimisation step the query/response pairs are used to calculate the log-probabilities of the tokens in the sequences. This is done with the model that is trained and and a reference model, which is usually the pre-trained model before fine-tuning. The KL-divergence between the two outputs is used as an additional reward signal to make sure the generated responses don't deviate to far from the reference language model. The active language model is then trained with PPO.\n",
